# full-stack-music-controller
 This is a personal project of a web music controller using React and Django
 
 I follow the tutorial created by Tech with Tim. Tutorial video linked below:
[Django & React Tutorial #1 - Full Stack Web App With Python & JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-age0BPVo&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kCLWnGmK0jUBmGLaJxvi4j&index=2) 

Major changes from the tutorial is that I changed the React structure from Class components to Functional components.
 
 The whole app is still under development and expected to be completed by the end of January 2023.
